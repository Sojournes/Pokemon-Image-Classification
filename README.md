# Pokémon Classifier

This project is a Pokémon image classifier built using neural networks with TensorFlow and Keras. The classifier can identify three Pokémon: Pikachu, Bulbasaur, and Meowth.

## Dataset

The dataset contains images of three Pokémon: Pikachu, Bulbasaur, and Meowth, each stored in separate folders. The images are resized to 40x40 pixels for processing.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python
```

## Data Preprocessing

The images are loaded, resized to 40x40 pixels, and converted to arrays. The labels are encoded as integers:

- Pikachu: 0
- Bulbasaur: 1
- Meowth: 2

The data is then shuffled and normalized.

## Model Architecture

The neural network model is a simple feedforward neural network with the following layers:

- Flatten layer to convert the 2D image arrays to 1D.
- Dense layer with 256 neurons and ReLU activation.
- Dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
- Dense output layer with 3 neurons and softmax activation.

## Training

The model is compiled with Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss. It is trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 32 and a validation split of 20%.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated on a test set, achieving an accuracy of approximately 87%. The training and validation loss are plotted for analysis.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using classification report and confusion matrix.

## Running the Code

To run the project, execute the `pokemon_classifier.py` script:

```bash
python pokemon_classifier.py
```

## Visualization

The script includes functions to visualize some sample images along with their predicted labels.

## Future Work

- Increase the dataset size for better accuracy.
- Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters.
- Implement data augmentation to improve model generalization.
